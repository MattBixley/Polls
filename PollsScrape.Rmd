# web scrape
collect the polls.csv data via code rather than a manual colation as previoulsy done from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2020_New_Zealand_general_election) table 3 the individual polls



```{r rvest}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2020_New_Zealand_general_election"
polls <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/div/table[1]') %>% 
  html_table()

polls <- polls[[1]]

cols <- colnames(polls)
party <- cols[-c(1:3)]
colnames(polls)[1:3] <- c("Date", "Poll", "Result")

# several notes have been added remove those rows by forcing a party results to numeric which returns NA for the comments
polls <- polls %>% filter(!is.na(as.numeric(polls$NAT))) %>% 
  select(-"Lead") %>% 
  mutate_at(.,party, ~as.numeric(.x)) %>% # make the polling data numeric
  




str(polls)


```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
